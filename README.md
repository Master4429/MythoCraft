Where Mythology Becomes Minecraft

"We started out creating this mod 3 years ago using McCreator (we didn't know how to code) we named it The Olympian Mod (based off rick riordan's books!) but after a while we all just stopped and the team kinda disbanded. A few days ago i contacted a friend and asked if we should continue, he happily agreed and we started it all over again changing our concept and we started using JDK+Eclipse, so that we could do more things, but ofcourse we have no experience modding. I myself, started modding by watching tutorials and by asking questions on a discord server dedicated for modding/texturing etc. and im learning on the go. but we would like to have someone in our team who is experienced with modding! about the mod itself, it's basically about all mythology! from Ancient Greek mythology to Norse mythology to Egyptian and the list could go on for a while. We're starting out small and sticking with Roman/Greek atm. Our goal is to have a minecraft worl filled with mythological mobs, items, (maybe even dimensions!) and all kinds of thing such as that.!"
